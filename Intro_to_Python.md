#Introduction to Python
Last time, we learned some of the basic priniples of coding using [Turtle Blocks] (https://turtle.sugarlabs.org/). 
This was coding in a graphical environment, where you create code by snapping together bricks. Our next step is to move into the way that most coders actually work, which is by programming using text. 
We will start by learning to program in a language called [Python] (https://www.python.org/).


##Getting Started in Python
[Python] (https://www.python.org/) is a very powerful computer programming language. It is used in all kinds of software. [Google] (https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl) uses it to process the searches you do. [Dropbox] (https://www.dropbox.com/), which is used by over 400 million people was originally written in Python. And the list goes on.

Let's start by getting used to how to work in Python.

###Working in Python -- The Basics
We will start by working in the console with some basic math.
Go to [Integer Arithmetic] (http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/integer.html) and try the examples there.
These examples will help you get used to working in Python.

###Working in Python - User Input
So far, you have been telling the computer what to do and watching it do it. 
Now, we are going to ask the user for some information, which we can use in the program itself.
Go to [Input] (http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/SimplePythonData/Input.html) and work through the examples there.

## Python Turtle Graphics
Turtle Blocks itself was originally created in Python. Python has a turtle library, which will let us create turtles and have them do all kinds of cool things. 
Let's explore how that works. 

###Our First Turtle Program
Let's get started. Go to [Our First Turtle Program] (http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/PythonTurtle/OurFirstTurtleProgram.html)
Work through all the examples on this page. This will give you the basics of programming your turtle(s). 

###More Turtle Programs - Now It's Your Turn
Now that you have the basics of how to program your turtles, let's play a little.
Here are a set of challenges (just like last time). Have your turtle:
* Draw a square
* Draw a square with different colors on each side
* Draw a square with randomly generated colors on each side
* Draw a rectangle with randomly generated colors on each side
* Draw a triangle with randomly generated colors on each side
* Draw a circle
* Write your first name in block letters

###Way Beyond the Basics
Now that you have some experience with Python Turtle Graphics, it's time for you to really play around.
[Here] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) you will find all the details about the various functions in Python Turtle Graphics. Look it over. Try things out. Share your successes (and failures).
