# Learning To Code
A mini course for high school students in learning the basics of coding using Python and Arduino

##Overview
This mini course is comprised of 5 two-hour sessions. The goal of these sessions to give the participants (we are expecting high school freshmen with no previous experience in coding) an experience of teaching a computer to talk through writing basic programs in [Python] (https://www.python.org/). Participants will also work to create an interactive device using the [Arduino] (http://arduino.cc/) microprocessor.
