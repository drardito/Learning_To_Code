##The Story So Far
Thanks to our reference, [Arduino in a Nutshell] (https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/arduino), we have been able to dive into the  text based programming of physical devices.

We have been working over the past two weeks to create some basic circuits for the [Arduino]( http://www.arduino.cc/). You have made lights [blink] (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink) and [buttons] (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Pushbutton) turn lights on and off. You have made [servos] (http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Servo) turn in response to force sensors.  

And our march to building a robot continues.

##Working with an Ultrasound Sensor
Now that you can wire circuits and do some programming, we are doing to add a new sensor -- the ultrasound sensor. It looks like two eyes, but one "eye" is generating a sound and the other detects it. This way, the sensor can be used to measure distance, just like a bat does with [echolocation]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_echolocation)

So, we are going to build tihs circuit:
